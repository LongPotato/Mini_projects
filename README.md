# Mini_projects README

This folder contain mini codes that I made for studying, practicing purpose

Square_rid is a dymanic website, using Java Script to generate a "sketch-pad". 
The code generates a grid of squares base on user input and those squares change color when the mouse hovers on them.

Learn_ruby contains small ruby functions to practice with specification using Rspec.

Slider is an image slide show that can be embeded later on to other website
